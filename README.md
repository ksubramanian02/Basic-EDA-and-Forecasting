## Project Topic: Bike Traffic

The objectives include: 

Identifying bridges to install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
Understanding if the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) can be used to predict the total number of bicyclists that day?
Can this data predict what day (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?

The nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City.
