## Project Topic: Bike Traffic

The nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv gives information on bike traffic across a number of bridges in New York City. In this path, the analysis questions we would like you to answer are as follows:

You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?
The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast(low/high temperature and precipitation) to predict the total number of bicyclists that day?
Can you use this data to predict what day (Monday to Sunday) is today based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?
readme-nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.pdf details the information contained in the data field.
